# Brain-Tumor-Auto-segmentation-for-MRI
This repo contain the files and codes for the brain tumors auto segmentations along with several data preprocessing activities.


# Expolre MRI data
Here we have explored the MRI data for the brain tumor auto segmanetation. The MEganatic resonance Imaging data help us to predict the auto segmanetion of brain tumors.


# Getting Sub Section
Here we have achieved the sub section/fatches from the MRI pictures in order to facilitate our model.
